# Introduction to Programming in OpenFOAM 12

This repository contains the example cases demonstrated in the **Introduction to Programming in OpenFOAM 12** series. You’ll find practical examples for:

1. **Custom Viscosity Model (Power Law)**
2. **Custom Boundary Conditions**
3. **Scalar Transport Equation**

These cases are designed to help you explore OpenFOAM’s extendability by adding, modifying, or creating entirely new functionalities.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   Clone this repository or download the ZIP file to your local machine.

2. **Explore Case Folders**  
   Inside each folder (e.g., `Session1_ViscosityModel`, `Session2_BoundaryCondition`, `Session3_ScalarTransport`), you’ll find the necessary `blockMeshDict`, solver files, and other configuration files.

3. **Run the Cases**  
   - Compile any custom boundary condition or viscosity model before running your simulation.  
   - Use the provided `Allrun` or `Allclean` scripts if available, or manually follow the steps indicated in each session’s documentation.

Feel free to modify the files to fit your own projects or experiment with different parameters.
